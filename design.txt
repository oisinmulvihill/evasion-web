This allows all configuration to be changed for agents, controllers and other
third party config and log files via a web based interface. This interface can
be integrated into applications or viewed directly in a web browser.

* Webadmin is a simple pylons app.
* Webadmin can stop/start/restart/reload agents in the director.
* Webadmin can stop/start/restart/reload controllers in the director.
* Webadmin is hooked into the event system and can subscribe to and recieve signals/events.
* Director collects Config and Logging information from others on the system.
* Agents/Controllers can send EVT_CONFIG_DETAILS + dict with a list of local files (log/ini) to edit.
* Webadmin Asks the director via EVT_CONFIGURATIONS for all the config details.
* Webadmin renders each config file in a tab holding some kind of plain text editor.
* Webadmin renders log files with an option to tail them to see them happening in real time.
* The webadmin is password protected and via a web browser requires a username/password to gain access.
